# Development Progress

## Completed Tasks

- **Task 1: Basic Setup**
  - Completed the basic setup of the Python development environment with required dependencies.
  
- **Task 2: Implementation of Transaction Algorithm**
  - Implemented the transaction algorithm where 'usefulness' increases by 1% per successful transaction up to 100%, and decreases by 10% per unsuccessful transaction, without going negative.

## In-Progress Tasks

- **Task 3: API Development**
  - Working on developing API endpoints for notifying transactions and updating user data accordingly.

## Future Tasks / Features

- **Task 4: User Authentication**
  - Implement user authentication mechanism to secure API endpoints.
  
- **Task 5: Testing**
  - Write unit tests for the transaction algorithm and API endpoints to ensure their correct functionality.
  
- **Task 6: Documentation**
  - Complete documentation, including the in-code comments and external documentation for API usage.

## Known Issues

- **Issue 1: Scalability Concerns**
  - The current implementation may need optimization for handling a large number of simultaneous requests efficiently.

## Change Log

### [0.1.0] - 2023-07-23
